# Machine-Learning-Based-Identification-of-Narcolepsy-Predictive-Genes

In this project, we leverage the power of ML methodologies to predict narcolepsy and uncover crucial genes implicated in disease susceptibility. By integrating genomic data from diverse sources and employing sophisticated ML algorithms, we aim to elucidate the genetic architecture of narcolepsy, paving the way for improved diagnostic strategies and targeted therapeutic interventions. Through a comprehensive analysis of narcolepsy-associated genes and their functional implications, we endeavour to enhance our understanding of this debilitating disorder and facilitate the development of personalised approaches for disease management.
